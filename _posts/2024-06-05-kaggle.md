<hr>
- An attempt to understand what Nitesh is doing while analyzing this data.
  - (1) Calling data.head() and data.describe() to check for columns that are uninformative. In this case a lot of the data is the word "NaN".
  - (2) Drop the columns that are not informative.
  - (3) Next we build a function to check if any values are missing.
    - A value is missing if it is null.
  - He finds that 0 are missing I find that authorities_contacted is missing 9.1%.
    - Q: What to do when we have missing values?
  - Next step is labelencoding?
  	- "#lets do Lable enconding coding to make more features" not sure what this means have to learn,
  - (4) Determine if any objects are binary.
  - Balanced data?
  	- Not sure what they mean about this. Why does it matter if data is balanced? Especially for fraud.
  - Run light gradient boosting model.
    - LightLGM
  - Test score differ by around .30
    - Author has different features(random variables).
    - Not reproducible.

- SUMMARY
  - Need to understand LightLGM
- STRUCTURE
  - (1)[FIND DATA FLAWS] -> [FIX DATA FLAWS] -> [DATA TYPES]
  - (2)[OBJ TO BINARY IF DATA[OBJ].UNIQUE() <= 2] -> [LightLGM on BINARY DATA]
  - (3)[TRAIN] -> [OUTPUT]
